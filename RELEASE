New capabilities:
-----------------
	- in libticalcs, the ability to send and receive raw DBUS, DUSB and NSP packets (wrapped into in TI's format for header, checksum, etc.).
	- variable rename and variable attribute change functions, mainly by Benjamin Moody.
	- new TI-Z80 ROM dumper by Benjamin Moody, with, among others, the ability to automatically dump 82 and 85, and the ability to unlock 73/83+/84+ Flash memory without an OS patch.
	- the ability to obtain screenshots from TI-80 VSC, by Randy Compton.
	- transferring Nspire OS extensions, currently limited to English-Chinese dictionaries.
	- Nspire remote control feature

Improvements:
-------------
	- USB scan at startup (options.auto_detect) is now enabled by default, to be more intuitive to users of TI's official software.
	- make the install_tilp.sh script sensitive to PREFIX and SRCDIR environment variables; abort early when $PREFIX cannot be written to.
	- improve test_ticalcs_2.
	- upgrade GTK+ runtime from 2.12.9 to 2.24.8.
	- switch from Glade to GTK+Builder for the TILP interface.
	- integrated tf2hex and the ROM dumpers into the autotools chain, by Benjamin Moody.
	- switched the source code and building process of the TI-Z80 ROM dumpers from tasm to spasm, by Benjamin Moody.
	- optimized the TI-68k ROM dumpers

Bug fixes:
----------
	- fixed 84+ product ID retrieval.
	- now honoring CFLAGS when compiling gfm & tilp "cleaner".
	- fixed FreeDesktop .desktop files (two steps).
	- now advertising ROM dumping support in CalcFncts calc_84p_usb.
	- suppressed name clashes between libticalcs' dusb_rpkt.h / nsp_rpkt.h and dusb_vpkt.h / nsp_vpkt.h.
	- protected {dbus,dusb,nsp}_{recv,send}, and other DUSB / NSP functions, against NULL parameters.
	- fixed several malloc/realloc/free vs. g_malloc/g_malloc0/g_free mismatches.
	- applied downstream Debian patches for fixing FTBFS on sh390x (Debian bug #641092), sh4 (Debian bug #567679) and sparc64 (Debian bug #596601).
	- made Glib 2.32 and later print info and debug messages, restoring the behaviour of older versions.
	- integrated a couple fixes to the 84+ DUSB ROM dumper, by Benjamin Moody.
	- fixes for spelling errors reported by alberthro and TC01.
	- fixes for i18n problems reported by Benjamin Moody.
