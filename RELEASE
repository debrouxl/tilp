			[ Release notes ]



Old     version:  1.15  (2011/05/28)
Current version:  1.16  (2011/12/xx)


SubVersion (SVN) revision: $Id$

TiLP is available for 4 platforms:
Linux (GTK/X11), Windows (GTK/GDI), Mac OS-X (GTK/X11) and FreeBSD (GTK/X11).


New capabilities:
-----------------
	- ability to get screenshots from Nspire CX calculators.
	- libticables now uses a libusb version that allows stable use of the filter driver, i.e. side-by-side usage of TI-Connect/TINC(L)S and TILP.
	- ability to transfer OS files to Nspire CX calculators.
	- ability to transfer OS files to Nspire CM calculators.

Improvements:
-------------
	- added several messages in the Linux device detection code, and unified / updated messages and translations.
	- when displaying calc information, print boot2 version if any; add several translatable strings and translations.
	- on Windows, redirect stdout to ~/.tilp.log (because the Windows terminal is too slow); eliminate explicit usage of stdout.
	- on Windows, add support for storing the config file in the home directory and for upgrading from a config file stored in the install directory.
	- add MIME types and FD.o desktop files.
	- 8xo file support - they used to be called 8xgrp by libtifiles/TILP.
	- improve drag&drop code, by Jon Sturm.
	- add Window, RclWin and TblSet tokens for CALC_TI82 and CALC_TI85 (SF bug #3438610).
	- add error codes returned by DUSB protocol calcs when refusing a FlashApp whose signature does not match, and by Nspires when they're out of memory.

Bug fixes:
----------
	- made Nspire support usable again on Windows, thanks to the libusb-win32 update.
	  The patch to libusb-win32 required by Nspires is now upstream, under the form of a new usb_reset_ex() function, as discussed with the
	  libusb-win32 maintainers.
	- fixed crashes in normal usage, and sanitized libti* function arguments.
	- ROM dumping of 84+(SE) and 89T through DirectLink.
	- sending files of sizes 244 modulo 250, larger than 244 bytes, to 84+(SE) through DirectLink.
	- fix the incorrect reporting of Flashapps' sizes for 73 / 83+ family, when the DBUS protocol is used (SF bug #3440569).
	- if we're talking to a 73, don't try to test for 83+SE. The oldest 73 OS versions don't support get_version.

Known bugs:
-----------

	- [nspire] sometimes need to restart TiLP if connection fails
	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support works but:
		* w/ libusb: you will have to replug link cable whenever you exit TiLP
		=> this bug is due to the Titanium USB internal firmware
