Starting from TiLP II v1.07, you don't need to download and install
the LPG's USB <a href="http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb/">driver</a> any
more. It has been replaced by libusb-win32 one which has auto-registering
capabilities. This driver is bundled with TiLP and TiEmu. Now, the TiLP
installer copies and installs those USB drivers automatically.<br>
<br>
Please note that those drivers are not compatible with TI-Connect(tm) and
TI-Nspire Computer Software (TINCS) / TI-Nspire Computer Link Software
(TINCLS). The drivers from TILP (libticables) will replace TI's drivers.
<strong>However, starting from TILP II 1.16, the filter driver capability
of libusb-win32 can be manually activated, so that TILP II 1.16+ and
TI-Connect / TINC(L)S can be simultaneously in a working state on a given
computer: see the instructions in the README file.</strong><br>
<br>
If you need to manually install them, they are located in C:\Program
Files\{Common Files}\LPG Shared\drivers\usb. {Common Files} is locale
dependent (aka depending on your platform language).<br>
An anonymous contributor has written this document which can be used for
manual installation of TiLP driver:<br>
<pre>1) Connect your calculator and turn it on.
2) Right-click "My Computer" and choose "Properties" out of the drop-down menu.
3) Click on the "Hardware" tab, then click the "Device Manager" button.
4) At the bottom should be "Universal Serial Bus controllers". Expand the list
(by clicking on the plus sign next to it).

5) In the list should be "TI Educational Handheld Device". Right-click it, and
choose "Update Driver..." from the drop-down menu.

6) At this time, the Hardware Update Wizard should pop up. It may ask you if
you want to connect to Windows Update to search for the driver. If not, go to
the next step, otherwise, click the button by "No, not at this time" and then
click next.

7) Click the button next to "Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)",
then click next.
8) Make sure the check box next to "Include this location in the search:" is
selected, then click the "Browse" button.

9) Browse to the driver folder. Click "OK" on the "Browse
For Folder" window, then "Next" on the Hardware Update Wizard window.

10)Now Windows should install the driver. In the middle you may get a warning
about the driver not being digitally signed. Just click "Continue Anyway".
11)Click finish on the Hardware Update Wizard. If everything's gone according
to plan, TiLP should work properly now! :) Also, when you go back to "Device
Driver", it will say "TI-GRAPH/DIRECT LINK USB" in place of "TI Educational
Handheld Device" (so long as your calculator is on and connected ;) ).

Hope this helps.

Follow above guidelines but locate and use TI-Connect driver instead of LPG's one. Usually, driver is located at C:\Program Files\Ti Education\drivers\.
