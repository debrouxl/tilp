.TH TILP 1 "December 31, 2008"
.SH NAME
TiLP2 - a communication program for TI calculators ('Tilp Is a Linking Program')
.SH SYNOPSYS
\fBtilp\fP [--help] [--version] [-h] [-v] [--calc=] [--cable=] [--port= ] [--timeout=] [--delay=] [--no-gui] [filename]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBTiLP\fP program allows you to backup, restore and archive variables and/or applications of your Texas Intruments calculator on your computer. It has also additional features such as screen dump, remote control, ROM dump, FLASHing. TiLP is a very complete program. Moreover, you have the same program for all calculator models.
.SH OPTIONS
The command line of tilp can be used for sending files like variables, backup, FLASH apps, OS, TiGroup, .... 
You can not do any other operations. If you want more operations, you have to use the GUI.
For sending one or more file, simply pass the filename(s) on the command line.
If you want to use TiLP from console, use the --no-gui switch.

Take care: options must be passed before the filename !

\fBtilp\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fP
Display a list of all command line options.
.TP
\fB-v, --version\fP
Output the version info.
.TP
\fB--no-gui\fP, \fB-n\fP
Send file(s) without launching any Graphical User Interface. All information is displayed in the console.
Beware: using this switch disables any overwrite check. Use it with care!
.TP
\fB--silent\fP, \fB-s\fP
Skip questions in no GUI mode. Should be used with --no-gui switch.
.TP
\fB--calc=\fP\fICALC\fP, \fICALC\fP
Select a calculator type: v200, ti92+, ti92, ti89t, ti89, ti86, ti85, ti84+, ti83+, ti83, ti82 or ti73.
.TP
\fB--cable=\fP\fICABLE\fP, \fICABLE\fP
Select a link cable type: GrayLink, BlackLink, Parallel, SilverLink, DirectLink, VTi, TiEmu.
.TP
\fB--port=\fP\fIPORT\fP, \fB-p\fP\fIPORT\fP
Specify on which port the link cable is plugged on. Can be null, 1, 2, 3 or 4.
.TP
\fB--timeout=\fP\fITIMEOUT\fP, \fB-t\fP\fITIMEOUT\fP
in tenth of seconds (0.1 s). This is the time while the program wait a response of the 
calculator. Once this delay elapsed, the program send a time out error. The 
default value is 1 seconds.
.TP
\fB--delay=\fP\fIDELAY\fP, \fB-d\fP\fIDELAY\fP
in microseconds. This is the time which separate the transmission of 2 bytes.
The default value is 5 microseconds. Decrease this value increase the 
transfer speed but decrease the reliability of the transmission.
.SH EXAMPLE
Quicly send (no gui) an TI89 file with a BlackLink cable on the second serial port (/dev/ttyS1 or COM2); timeout is set to 2s:
.TP
tilp --calc=ti89 --cable=BlackLink --port=2 --timeout=20 --no-gui group.89g
.TP
Starting at version 1.13, a new & shorter syntax can be used:
.TP
tilp ti89 blacklink -p2 -t20 -n group.89g

.SH CONFIG FILE FORMAT
This section describes the format of the .tilp config file which is in the home directory of the user (Linux) or the tilp.ini file (Win32). The file is separated into several sections (hardware, gui, calc, external programs, fonts, screen, misc). But, there is no order, you can write lines as you want.
A line preceded by the '#' symbol is a comment. Each line has the following format: option=something.
Every line can be put in any order. Beware: any comment added to the file will be overwritten !
Below is described each option and the possible values:

\fBversion=\fP

\fBcable_model=\fP
Define the link cable type (case sensitive). Choose one of the following value: GrayLink, BlackLink, Parallel, SilverLink, DirectLink, VTi or TiEmu.

\fBcable_port=\fP
Define the port to use. You have to choose one of the following value depending on your link cable type and the port you want use: parallel port #[1-3], serial port #[1-4], virtual port #[1-2], USB port #[1-4].

\fBcable_timeout=\fP
with the timeout value to use in tenth of seconds. Default value: 20.

\fBcable_delay=\fP
with the delay value to use in micro-seconds for home-made cables. Default value: 10

\fBpane_x_size=\fP and \fBpane_y_size=\fP
Gives the width and height values of the remote view.

\fBwnd_x_size1=\fP and \fBwnd_y_size1=\fP
Gives the width and height of the windows in full view.

\fBwnd_x_size2=\fP and \fBwnd_y_size2=\fP
Gives the width and height of the windows in simplified view (no right frame).

\fBlocal_sort=\fP
Define the sorting method for the right window. Choose one of the following value: name, date, size, user, group, attrib

\fBlocal_sort_order=\fP
Define the sorting order for the right window. Choose either 'up' or 'down'.
