DESCRIPTION
-----------

TILP is a program allowing a computer to communicate with TI graphing
calculators (TI-Z80, TI-68k and Nspire series).

It works on Linux, Windows, Mac OS-X and FreeBSD platforms.
See README.linux, README.win32 or README.freebsd according to your
platform for more information.

All physical link cables are supported by TILP: parallel, serial,
BlackLink, GrayLink, AVRlink, SilverLink and DirectLink.
TILP also support some virtual links: one for Virtual TI, the other one for
TIEmu.

Note1: the SilverLink cable may not work fine with TI-82/85.

Supported calculators are: 
	TI-73, TI-76.fr, TI-82 / TI-82 Stats(.fr), TI-83, TI-83+(SE), TI-84+(SE),
	TI-84+ Pocket(.fr), TI-84+CSE (partially), TI-85, TI-86;
	TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92, TI-92 II, TI-92+, V200;
	Nspire Clickpad & Touchpad & CX & CM-C (CAS & non-CAS).


FEATURES
--------

Note: some features may depend on the OS version.
Be sure to have the latest OS version... *except on the Nspire*, because newer
OS versions tend to contain unwanted changes (backwards incompatibilities in
documents, anti-downgrade protections, fixes for vulnerabilities that allowed
native code programs, etc.).

NSpire (CAS):
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving/deleting file
  - creating folders
  - upgrading OS
  - version
  - remote control

TI-89/TI-89 Titanium/TI-92+/V200:
  - remote control of the calculator
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - ROM dump
  - sending/receiving/deleting FLASH applications
  - upgrading of Operating System (AMS)
  - getting/setting time (requires AMS >= 2.08)

TI-92:
  - remote control of the calculator
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - ROM version
  - ROM dump (FARGO II required)

TI-86:
  - screen dump
  - sending/receiving backup (old & new ti86 calcs)
  - sending/receiving variable
  - TIGL file support
  - ROM dump

TI-85:
  - screen dump
  - sending/receiving backup
  - sending/receiving variable
  - TIGL file support
  - ROM dump

TI-83+/TI-84+ (standSE or not SE):
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving backup (archived vars are not backed up !)
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving/deleting FLASH applications
  - upgrading of Operating System (GRAPH EXPLORER SOFTWARE)
  - ROM dump

Note: the TI-83+ family is the only set to have a GROUP variable. TILP supports
it in a specific way: this kind of var is saved as a single file as any other
variable. Thus, if you send it, it will stay grouped on calc.
The TI's software has a different way: it explodes the GROUP variable
into a .8Xg group file and you lose the grouping on calculator.

TI-83 / TI-82 Stats(.fr) / TI-76.fr:
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - TIGL file support
  - ROM dump

TI-82:
  - screen dump
  - sending/receiving variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - TIGL files support
  - ROM dump

TI-73:
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving variable
  - sending/receiving of FLASH applications
  - upgrading of Operating System (GRAPH EXPLORER SOFTWARE)
  - ROM dump
