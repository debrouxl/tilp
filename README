DESCRIPTION
-----------

TiLP is a program allowing a PC to communicate with 
a TI calculator.

It works on Linux, Windows, Mac OS-X and FreeBSD platforms.
See README.linux, README.win32 or README.freebsd according to your
platform for more information.

All physical link cables are supported by TiLP: parallel, serial, 
BlackLink, GrayLink, AVRlink, SilverLink and DirectLink.
TiLP also support some virtual links: one for VirtualTI, the other one for
GtkTiEmu.

Note1: the SilverLink cable may not work fine TI82/85.
Note2: remote control is not supported by DirectLink yet.

Supported calculators are: 
	TI73, TI82, TI83, TI83+(SE), TI84+(SE), TI85, TI86, 
	TI89, TI89 Titanium, TI92, TI92+ and V200,
	NSpire (CAS and non-CAS).


FEATURES
--------

Note: some features may depend on the OS version.
Be sure to have the latest OS version... except maybe on the Nspire, because newer
OS versions tend to contain with unwanted changes (backwards incompatibilities
in documents, anti-downgrade protections, fixes for vulnerabilities that allowed
native code programs, etc.).

NSpire (CAS):
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving/deleting file
  - creating 
  - upgrading OS
  - version

TI89/TI89 Titanium/TI92+/V200:
  - remote control of the calculator
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - ROM dump
  - sending/receiving/deleting FLASH applications
  - upgrading of Operating System (AMS)
  - getting/setting time (need AMS >= 2.08)

TI92:
  - remote control of the calculator
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - ROM version
  - ROM dump (FARGO II required)

TI86:
  - screen dump
  - sending/receiving backup (old & new ti86 calcs)
  - sending/receiving variable
  - TIGL file support
  - ROM dump

TI85:
  - screen dump
  - sending/receiving backup
  - sending/receiving variable
  - TIGL file support
  - ROM dump

TI83+/TI84+ (SE or not SE):
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving backup (archived vars are not backed up !)
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving/deleting FLASH applications
  - upgrading of Operating System (GRAPH EXPLORER SOFTWARE)
  - ROM dump

Note: the TI83+ is the only calc to have a GROUP variable. TiLP supports it in
a specific way: this kind of var is saved as a single file as any other
variable. Thus, if you send it, it will stay grouped on calc.
The TI's software has a different way: it explodes the GROUP variable
into a .8Xg group file and you lose the grouping on calculator.

TI83:
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - TIGL file support
  - ROM dump

TI82:
  - screen dump
  - sending/receiving variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - TIGL files support
  - ROM dump

TI73:
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving variable
  - sending/receiving of FLASH applications
  - upgrading of Operating System (GRAPH EXPLORER SOFTWARE)
  - ROM dump
